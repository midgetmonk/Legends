## Installation
To install the system, paste the manifest URL below into the Install System dialog on the Setup menu:
  * `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/pacosgrove1%2Flegends/packages/generic/legends/latest/system.json`

## Usage
See [the Wiki](https://gitlab.com/pacosgrove1/legends/-/wikis/home) for specific usage examples.

**Please note:** there is **no** game content included in this system, but I do have [a separate Foundry module](https://gitlab.com/pacosgrove1/legends-compendia) that contains all the Playbook and Play Material data available on the [official site](https://magpiegames.com/pages/avatarrpg) downloads, formatted for easy adding to Player and NPC sheets.

## Credits
This system exists thanks to the excellent YouTube tutorial series by [CÃ©dric Hauteville](https://www.youtube.com/user/LieutenantRazak).
